### Tech descripton and specification

This responsive website is included four web pages. All pages are responsive, works with broad varieties of screens, in range from mobile devices (min-width: 320px) to desktops (min-width 1200px). This cross-devices website affords users to feel comfortable interact with content on this website whether the size of the screen their device has.

This project is implemented fallow technologies:
```
- HTML;
- CSS;
- JavaScript;
- SASS;
- weather API (fetch data from weather API);

```
I used HTML to the markup of all web pages. CSS helped me implemented all styling solutions. I used SASS for setting up all selectors' features and compiled them into a CSS style master file. All algorithms of DOM manipulating were implemented with JavaScript. I got existed DOM elements, create new classes on the fly, build new elements, transform the navigation bar, and so on with JS. Moreover, I used JS for the weather widget, I designed an algorithm, this algorithm fetched weather API and add it inside my weather widget.
